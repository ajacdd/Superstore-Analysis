# Superstore-Analysis
- Data source: Tableau Sample Superstore
- Tools: SQL (MySQL), Tableau

## Introduction
Superstore is a U.S. based small retail business that sells furniture, office supplies, and technology products. Their customer segments are mass Consumers, Corporate, and Home Offices. The project aims to provide a thorough analysis of Superstore sales performance and trends to reveal key insights that can be used to guide data-driven decision-making. Using a detailed dataset, the project explores multiple facets of the business, including sales trends, product popularity, regional market performance, and more. This report highlights key metrics, analyzes category and product performance, examines regional sales trends, and offers strategic insights and recommendations to optimize sales and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.

## Requirements
The Superset dataset used in this project was obtained from Tableau and converted from a XSLX file to a CSV file for easier handling. The analysis was performed using MySQL and complemented using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

The dataset contains 3 tables: orders, returns, and people. The “orders” table includes the following columns:
-	row_id: unique ID of each row
-	order_id: ID of each order placed
-	order_date: date on which an order was placed
-	ship_date: date on which an order shipped
-	ship_mode: Second Class, Standard Class, First Class, Same Day
-	customer_id: unique ID of a customer
-	customer_name: first and last name
-	segment: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
-	country: United States
-	city: name of city
-	state: name of state
-	postal_code: 5-digit zip code
-	region: Central, East, South, West
-	product_id: unique ID of each product
-	category: Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology
-	subcategory: Accessories, Appliances, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers, Envelopes, Fasteners, Furnishings, Labels, Machines, Paper, Phones, Storage, Supplies, Tables
-	product_name: short description of product name
-	sales: revenue generated by the sale of goods
-	quantity: number of individual units sold
-	discount: discounts applied to units in an order
-	profit: profit generated from the sale of goods

The “returns” table includes the following columns:
-	returned: denotes 'Yes' where order was returned
-	order_id: ID of each order returned

The “people” table includes the following columns:
-	person: first and last name of regional sales person
-	region: Central, East, South, West

## Business Questions
1.	What is the yearly total sales, profit, and YOY % variance?
2.	What is the total sales, average sales, and percent of total sales for each category?
3.	Which subcategories have the highest and lowest total profit overall?
4.	Which customer segments generated the most and least profits?
5.	What is the top and bottom selling product in each segment (unit sales)?
6.	How many orders were placed compared to orders returned each year?
7.	What is the total sales, value of returned orders, and net sales by region along with the associated regional salesperson?
8.	How many orders and items shipped 7+ days after the order date?

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
#### Duplicate values
After creating the database, tables, and importing values from the .csv file in MySQL, I checked for duplicate values. Duplicate values in a dataset can lead to skewed or inaccurate analyses by artificially inflating the size of the data and/or creating misleading results.

```
SELECT
	customer_name, COUNT(customer_name),
	order_date, COUNT(order_date),
	order_id, COUNT(order_id),
	customer_id, COUNT(customer_id),
	product_id, COUNT(product_id),
	sales, COUNT(sales),
	discount, COUNT(discount),
	quantity, COUNT(quantity)
FROM
	superstore.orders
GROUP BY
	customer_name, order_date, order_id, customer_id, product_id, sales, discount, quantity
HAVING
	COUNT(customer_name) > 1 
	AND COUNT(order_date) > 1 
	AND COUNT(order_id) > 1 
	AND COUNT(customer_id) > 1 
	AND COUNT(product_id) > 1 
	AND COUNT(sales) > 1 
	AND COUNT(discount) > 1 
	AND COUNT(quantity) > 1;
```

There appears to be 1 exact duplicate entry across all columns for customer "Laurel Beltran" (row_id 3406 and 3407). For the purpose of this project, I assumed this was an error and deleted the second entry. (Note: in a real-life business situation, I'd first want to confirm with the Order Management Team before removing.)

```
DELETE FROM superstore.orders
WHERE row_id = 3407;
```
#### Null values
Checking for null values in a dataset involves identifying any missing or undefined data in each column. Understanding the presence and distribution of null values helps in making informed decisions about how to handle them. There were no null values found in the dataset.

#### Update table
Next, I decided to update the orders table schema to add a new “order_year" column by extracting the year from order_date. This allows for easier filtering by year.
```
ALTER TABLE superstore.orders
ADD COLUMN order_year INT AFTER order_id;

UPDATE superstore.orders
SET order_year = YEAR(order_date);
```

## Data Analysis
1.	What is the yearly total sales, profit, and YOY percent variance?
```
WITH yearly_totals AS 
	(SELECT order_year, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
	FROM superstore.orders
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 1)

SELECT
	order_year, total_sales, total_profit,
	(total_sales/LAG(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY order_year) - 1)*100 AS yoy_sales_perc_var,
	(total_profit/LAG(total_profit) OVER(ORDER BY order_year) - 1)*100 AS yoy_profit_perc_var
FROM yearly_totals;
